# Green Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project I was able to help Steve analyze data in order for him to have a better understanding of Green Energy stocks to help his parents future investments. I utilized Visual Basic for Applications, VBA, through excel in order to present the activity in different stocks throughout the years. The stock activity was measured by obtaining the daily volume or number of shares as well as the percentage of annual return per stock. 
Initially, I focused my analysis on the parents preferred stock, DQ, and then I was able to do an analysis on the other stocks in the data to present which stocks were a better investment for Steveâ€™s parents moving forward.
