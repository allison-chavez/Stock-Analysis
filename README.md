# Green Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project I was able to help Steve analyze data in order for him to have a better understanding of Green Energy stocks to help his parents future investments. I utilized Visual Basic for Applications, VBA, through excel in order to present the activity in different stocks throughout the years 2017 and 2018. The stock activity was measured by obtaining the daily volume or number of shares as well as the percentage of annual return per stock. Initially, I focused my analysis on the parents preferred stock, DQ, and then I was able to do an analysis on the other stocks in the data to present which stocks were a better investment for Steve’s parents moving forward. 
#### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to see which Green Energy stocks were going to be the best investment for Steve’s parents. This was completed by running an analysis on the preferred stock, DQ, and then for the other 11 stocks. I completed my initial analysis for all stocks and then was purposely challenged to refactor my code to make it run more efficiently and readily throughout the data. The overall scheme of this project was to provide comprehensible stock data in different efficient ways.
